# Task Description

In this task, we had to make the pick and place aspect of our bike dynamic. We would not be provided the configuration for pick and place before hand. Instead, it would be provided to us when the evaluator starts by a script in the form of a lua string. So, we had to make our code fully automated and generic. We had to make provisions so that our bike would pick any number of objects(less than or equal to 8 which is the maximum limit). Also, we had to write code to figure out the configuration of what to pick up, how much to pick up and which dairy product should be delivered where. We had to also add a feature to our bike to automatically determine the positions of the feeds kept on the table so that they would not collide with the dairy products while placing. Also, we had to write code to optimize the speed of our arm's pick and place so that it takes minimum amount of time to complete the task given to us.<br/>
