### Theme Introduction:
In this theme, the team will develop a Self-Balancing Bike, which will deliver various items throughout the cityscape. The delivery order will be decided by the priority of the package, thus posing a challenge in path planning. While development, you will learn the basics of the Control System and LQR controller design. The main challenges faced in this theme will be:

* Balancing of 2-wheeled Delivery Bike.
* Autonomous Navigation of Delivery Bike.
* Pickup and delivery in the arena.

<b> Concepts used: </b> Self-Balancing Robot, State-Space Modelling, Euler-Lagrange Mechanics, Linear Quadratic Regulator, Lua Language, Octave Programming, Coppelia Sim, Fusion 360.

For sharing resources of the Dairy Bike project in eYRC 2021.
