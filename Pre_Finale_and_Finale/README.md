# Task Description

This task's score was the final score that would be submitted by our team for the final round. We had the same task as those in Task 6. Again, the only difference here was that the configuration was changed to test the generic nature of our code. Also, we had only 3 hours to submit the output of this task and submit the youtube video for it from the time of dowload of the configuration by us.<br/>


The video submitted in the finals(without subtitles version)
